# Catalytic_methane_conversion
A model to estimate the mass of 6.5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst for a given CH4 conversion. The model was developed based on the relation and data published by Alyani and Smith (2016). The model estimates the steady state conversion of methane by 6.5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 at different temperatures.
